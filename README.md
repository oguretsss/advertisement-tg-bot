# Simple telegram bot for posting user generated advertisements into channel.
Users of your channel can post messages in channels using this bot.
They simply need to write a message to bot. Bot will prompt them if they want their message to be posted to your public channel with link to author.
If the user agrees, their message will be posted to the channel. This may be useful for channels where users can buy/sell stuff.
Currently, bot supports text and photos.
